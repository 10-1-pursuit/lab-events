// Tic Tac Toe

// You will need to complete the following tasks. If you're unclear about any of the instructions below, reach out to your instructor.

// - [ ] Write a function called `makeBoard()` that will generate 9 `div` with the class `empty` and another class `square`.
// - [ ] Call `makeBoard()` on page load so that 9 squares appear and the board is 3 x 3 squares.
const see = console.log;

const makeBoard = () => {
  function createSquares() {
    const main = document.querySelector("#wrapper");
    const div = document.createElement("div");
    div.classList.add(".empty .square");
    main.append(div);
  }

  con;
};

// - [ ] Write a function called `makeMove()` that is an event handler for the `div`s with the class of `square` that

//   - Checks if the clicked square has the class `empty`.
//   - If the square has the class empty add either an `X` or an `O` inside the square, remove the class `empty` and write some logic so that the next time this function is called the other player has a play (first play an X then an O, then an X...).
//   - Players should NOT be able to change a full square.

// - [ ] Add a listener to the reset button and write an event handler function called `reset`, that removes the squares and then calls `makeBoard()` to reset the board.

// Tic Tac Toe Demo

//  Additional Features

// Write a function that checks if all the squares are full. If they are, make a pop up that says "Game Over"

// Create some game logic that checks if X or O won and create a message displaying who won.
